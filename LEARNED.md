# What I Learned

## Previous Knowledge
I already knew mostly about using git. Github is definately a usful feature to communicate with the people all around the world doing project.
- git add 
- git clone
- git checkout [-b]
- git pull
- git rebase
- git reset 
- etc ...

## New Knowledge
But one new thing is that I can create a profile README.
I am willing to soon make the md file for my profile.
