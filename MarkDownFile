# What I Learned
* I learned more about the different types of formats that files can be written in within GitHub repositories (I was previously not aware of the different formats, like creating Markdown files)

# What I am confused about 
* I am not confused about anything in particular! :) The walkthrough of the assignments was pretty clear.
