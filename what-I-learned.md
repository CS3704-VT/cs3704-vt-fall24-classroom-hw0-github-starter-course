## What I learned from reading HW0
- I suppose you could say that I finally put an action to what a pull request is, however I am still a
bit confused about them. It seems like you are asking permission to pull saying what you will do. 
But it also sounds like you are trying to merge changes you already made. I may need to find 
clarification aobut that.
- Issues is a new part of git that I also learned about for the first time. It doesn't seem so 
different from Jira issues which ia a thing I have seen before.
