# Pull Request

## Summary
This pull request completes the GitHub introductory assignment. It covers the basics of GitHub flow, including cloning, committing, pushing, and creating pull requests. The project now contains the necessary files and commits for review.

## Changes Made
- Added a README.md file with details about the project.
- Created a new branch to isolate the work from the main branch.
- Committed changes that provide instructions on how to clone the repository, make edits, and push changes.

## What I Learned
- **Cloning:** I learned how to clone a repository to my local machine and work on it offline.
- **Committing:** I practiced committing changes with meaningful messages to track the progress of the project.
- **Branches:** I created and worked with branches to isolate changes before merging them into the main project.
- **Pull Requests:** I understood the use of pull requests to submit changes for review and collaboration.

## Next Steps
- I would like to explore more advanced GitHub features such as working with issues and managing pull requests with multiple collaborators.

## Additional Notes
- This assignment was a helpful introduction to Git and GitHub, and I now feel more comfortable working with version control systems.
